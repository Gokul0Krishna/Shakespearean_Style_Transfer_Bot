    Prepare Dataset

        Use Shakespeare’s works (available in public domain, e.g., Project Gutenberg).
        
        Clean and tokenize the text.

    Train the GPT-v1 Model

        Start with the notebook in the repo.

        Train on Shakespeare text (character-level or word-level).

        Save the trained model weights.

    Build a Translator Wrapper

        Take modern input text.

        Encode it → feed to model → generate continuation.

        Add some post-processing:

            Replace common words with archaic equivalents (e.g., “you → thou”, “are → art”).

            Keep GPT-generated flow.

    Add an Interface

        Web app with Streamlit or Flask:

            Text box for input.

            Generate button.

            Output Shakespearean text.

    (Optional) Visualize Attention

        For bonus learning, show a heatmap of attention heads for the generated sentence.

        Users can see which words the model focused on.

Deliverables

    A trained GPT-v1 model on Shakespeare.

    A small app (CLI, Flask, or Streamlit) that converts modern English to Shakespearean style.

    (Optional) Attention visualization panel.

data prep → training → generation → web app




2. Positional Embeddings

Transformers don’t naturally understand order (they just look at sets of tokens).

To fix this, we add positional encodings that tell the model where each token is in the sequence.

Example for the sentence "To be":

Token embeddings:
  "To" → [0.23, -0.11, 0.98]
  "be" → [0.65, 0.02, -0.33]

Positional embeddings:
  pos 0 → [0.10, 0.20, 0.30]
  pos 1 → [-0.05, 0.15, -0.25]

Final input (sum of both):
  "To" @ pos 0 → [0.33, 0.09, 1.28]
  "be" @ pos 1 → [0.60, 0.17, -0.58]


👉 This way, the model knows "To" came before "be".

🔹 3. Transformer Block = Attention + Feedforward

Each block has 2 main parts:

(a) Self-Attention

Every token looks at other tokens in the same context to decide what’s important.

Example: In "To be, or not to be", when predicting "be", the model pays strong attention to the earlier "be" to capture repetition.

This is done using Q, K, V matrices (queries, keys, values).

Queries ask: “What am I looking for?”

Keys answer: “What do I contain?”

Values are the actual information passed along.

(b) Feedforward Network

After attention mixes information, each token’s representation is passed through a small MLP (linear → ReLU → linear).

This transforms features nonlinearly.

Think of it as “processing” after “looking”.

🔹 4. Stacked n_layer Blocks

One block isn’t enough to capture deep patterns.

So GPT stacks many transformer blocks (like layers in a CNN).

Lower layers → capture short-range dependencies (local word relations).

Higher layers → capture global meaning (themes, style).

Example with 6 layers:

Input → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → ... → Layer 6 → Output

🔹 5. Linear Head for Vocabulary Prediction

At the very end:

Each token’s hidden state (vector) is projected back into vocabulary size.

Example: hidden state [0.3, -0.5, 0.9] → logits [2.1, -0.7, 0.5, ...] for every vocab word.

Apply softmax → probability distribution over next token.

So the model says:

Given context "To be",
Next word probs:
   "or" → 0.65
   "and" → 0.15
   "the" → 0.10
   ...


✅ In short, the repo builds GPT-v1 step by step:

Token embeddings → words become vectors.

Positional embeddings → add order info.

Transformer block (attention + feedforward) → tokens communicate.

Stack multiple layers → deeper understanding.

Linear + softmax head → predict the next token.
