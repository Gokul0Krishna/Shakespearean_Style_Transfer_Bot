    Prepare Dataset

        Use Shakespeare’s works (available in public domain, e.g., Project Gutenberg).
        
        Clean and tokenize the text.

    Train the GPT-v1 Model

        Start with the notebook in the repo.

        Train on Shakespeare text (character-level or word-level).

        Save the trained model weights.

    Build a Translator Wrapper

        Take modern input text.

        Encode it → feed to model → generate continuation.

        Add some post-processing:

            Replace common words with archaic equivalents (e.g., “you → thou”, “are → art”).

            Keep GPT-generated flow.

    Add an Interface

        Web app with Streamlit or Flask:

            Text box for input.

            Generate button.

            Output Shakespearean text.

    (Optional) Visualize Attention

        For bonus learning, show a heatmap of attention heads for the generated sentence.

        Users can see which words the model focused on.

Deliverables

    A trained GPT-v1 model on Shakespeare.

    A small app (CLI, Flask, or Streamlit) that converts modern English to Shakespearean style.

    (Optional) Attention visualization panel.
